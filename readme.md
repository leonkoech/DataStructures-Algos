## Top Interview Questions on Data Stracture and Algorithms
### Based on Top Interview Questions on leet code and most asked interview questions on geeks - Easy mostly(A few medium(1-2 questions each))
### I can also add some geeks for geeks questions and some behavioral questions in general

### This is my self taught DS and Algos compilation. I also do the test cases just in case for the real interview
### Commented out is the time complexity of the algorithms and space complexity. Again, because I'm teaching myself feel free to correct the code or add another solution to the posted one if it's easier for people to understand
